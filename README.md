### Steps to reproduce results

1. Clone repository
2. Use ```kaggle competitions download -c mais-202-fall-2020-kaggle-competition``` to download the train and test data for the competition
3. Put all files downloaded in same folder as the repository
4. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies for the project
4. Run ```generate-bigger-dataset.py``` with the number of instances per class you wish to have as the NUM_PER_CLASS variable (might run out of RAM if numbers are too high, our results were achieved using 15000 instances per class)
5. Once generation is finished, run ```model.py```
6. Once validation accuracy reaches a plateau, run ```predict.py```, replacing the ```weights_path``` variable with the path of the best weights generated by ```model.py``` and changing the path to save the predictions to as desired in the ```np.savetxt``` function
